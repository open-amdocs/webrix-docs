Determine whether the given component has been mounted, unmounted, or neither.

## Basic Example

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
    const mounted = useMounted();

    if (mounted) {
        // Do something if the component has been mounted
    }

    return (...);
}
```

In this example we have a condition based on whether `MyComponent` has been mounted

## Syntax

```js
const mounted = useMounted();
```

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {useMounted} from 'webrix/hooks';

// For better tree shaking
import {useMounted} from 'webrix/hooks/useMounted';

// UMD
const {useMounted} = Webrix.hooks;
```

### Parameters

None

### Return Value

`useMounted()` - Returns a boolean for whether the component is mounted or not. If this is
the initial render, or if the component has been unmounted, it will be `false`, otherwise it
will be `true`.

This is illustrated in the table below:

Hook|Initial Render|Mounted|Unmounted
---|---|---|---
`useMounted()`|`false`|`true`|`false`
