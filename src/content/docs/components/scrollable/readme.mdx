import {Example} from 'components';

The `<Scrollable/>` component can be used to apply custom scrollbar styling to a scrollable element.
It does so by hiding the native scrollbars, and displaying real DOM elements instead.

The `<Scrollable/>` component therefore behaves just like any native element would,
because it's nothing but a scrollable div. JS and CSS applied to `<Scrollable/>` works just like
it would have if you were using the native scrollbars, with the benefit of having real DOM access to the scrollbars.

The positioning of the scrollbars is determined by the `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft` properties of the container.

## Vertical Scroll

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/VerticalScroll' height={300}/>

In this example we have a `<Scrollable/>` with content that overflows it vertically.
Due to that overflow, the element can be scrolled vertically, and a vertical scrollbar appears.

## Horizontal Scroll

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/HorizontalScroll' height={250}/>

Same as the previous story, only here the content overflows horizontally.

## Minimal Thumb Size

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/MinimalThumbSize' height={300}/>

The thumb size is affected by the content's length - the longer the content is, the smaller
the thumb is - down to a minimum size of `MIN_THUMB_SIZE` of the container's size.

In other words, there's a limit to how small a scrollbar thumb can be. The purpose of that
limit is to avoid having a thumb too small for the user to click on.

## Resize Detection

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/ResizeDetection' height={400}/>

This example shows how the `<Scrollable/>` scrollbars are automatically updated when one of the `<Scrollable/>`
ancestors is resized (if that resize directly affects the scrollbars).

Internally, `<Scrollable/>` uses the `ResizeObserver` to listen to dimension changes.

## Scrollbar Shadow

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/ScrollbarShadow' height={300}/>

Sometimes you want to indicate to the user that there's more content to see, that is currently
invisible because it overflows that container. One common way of indicating that is by an inset shadow.

The `<Scrollable.Shadow/>` allows you to easily add that indication, for both vertically and horizontally scrollable elements.
All you need to do is wrap your `<Scrollable/>` element with `<Scrollable.Shadow/>`, and add `position: relative` to the container.

The `<Scrollable.Shadow/>` will display shadow in the direction in which the content is overflowing.
The further away you scroll from the beginning/end, the deeper the shadow will become.

## Custom Scrollbars

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/CustomScrollbars' height={300}/>

If you want to have some custom scrollbars, you can do so by providing your own scrollbar component.
This can be done by passing `<Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>` and/or `<Scrollbar.HorizontalScrollbar>`
as children, and passing your custom scrollbar as a child to them.

In this example you can see a custom vertical scrollbar, positioned outside the container, featuring
a vivid gradient.

To simplify the implementation, we are using the default scrollbar `<Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar.Default>`
as our base scrollbar.

```jsx
<Scrollbar>
    {...}
    <Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>
        <MyCustomScrollbar/>
    </Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>
</Scrollbar>
```

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Scrollable} from 'webrix/components';
import Scrollable from 'webrix/components/Scrollable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Scrollable} = Webrix.components;
```
### Props
Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`children`|node|`null`|Specifies the scrollable content.
`element`|node|`<div/>`|Specifies the scrollable element.
`style`|object|`{}`|Specifies a style object to be used for styling the scrollbar. NOTE: This should only be used for values that are computed in runtime using JavaScript. Static values should be applied using CSS.
`scrollOnDOMChange`|boolean|`true`|Specifies whether the scroll position should update when there's a change in the internal DOM structure. When set to `true`, adding an element above the visible area will update the scroll position so that the previously visible area is still visible.
`onScroll`|function|`() => null`|Specifies function to be called when a scroll event occurs. Receives an object with the following properties: `top`, `left`, `scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`, `scrollHeight`, `scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`,
