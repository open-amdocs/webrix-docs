import {Example, PreviewList} from 'components';

The `<Scrollable/>` component can be used to apply custom scrollbar styling to a scrollable element.
It does so by hiding the native scrollbars, and displaying real DOM elements instead.

The `<Scrollable/>` component therefore behaves just like any native element would,
because it's nothing but a scrollable div. JS and CSS applied to `<Scrollable/>` works just like
it would have if you were using the native scrollbars, with the benefit of having real DOM access to the scrollbars.

The positioning of the scrollbars is determined by the `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft` properties of the container.

## Vertical Scroll

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/VerticalScroll' height={300}/>

In this example we have a `<Scrollable/>` with content that overflows it vertically.
Due to that overflow, the element can be scrolled vertically, and a vertical scrollbar appears.

## Horizontal Scroll

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/HorizontalScroll' height={250}/>

Same as the previous story, only here the content overflows horizontally.

## Minimal Thumb Size

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/MinimalThumbSize' height={300}/>

The thumb size is affected by the content's length - the longer the content is, the smaller
the thumb is - down to a minimum size given by `----scrollable-min-thumb-length`, which defaults to `30px`.

In other words, there's a limit to how small a scrollbar thumb can be. The purpose of that
limit is to avoid having a thumb too small for the user to click on.

## Resize Detection

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/ResizeDetection' height={400}/>

This example shows how the `<Scrollable/>` scrollbars are automatically updated when one of the `<Scrollable/>`
ancestors is resized (if that resize directly affects the scrollbars).

Internally, `<Scrollable/>` uses the `ResizeObserver` to listen to dimension changes.

## Scrollbar Shadow

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/ScrollbarShadow' height={300}/>

Sometimes you want to indicate to the user that there's more content to see, that is currently
invisible because it overflows that container. One common way of indicating that is by an inset shadow.

The `<Scrollable.Shadow/>` allows you to easily add that indication, for both vertically and horizontally scrollable elements.
All you need to do is wrap your `<Scrollable/>` element with `<Scrollable.Shadow/>`, and add `position: relative` to the container.

The `<Scrollable.Shadow/>` will display shadow in the direction in which the content is overflowing.
The further away you scroll from the beginning/end, the deeper the shadow will become.

## Custom Scrollbars

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/CustomScrollbars' height={300}/>

If you want to have some custom scrollbars, you can do so by providing your own scrollbar component.
This can be done by passing `<Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar>` and/or `<Scrollable.HorizontalScrollbar>`
as children, and passing your custom scrollbar as a child to them.

In this example you can see a custom vertical scrollbar, positioned outside the container, featuring
a vivid gradient.

To simplify the implementation, we are using the default scrollbar `<Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar.Default>`
as our base scrollbar.

```jsx
<Scrollable>
    {...}
    <Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar>
        <MyCustomScrollbar/>
    </Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar>
</Scrollable>
```

## Custom Element

<Example file='docs/components/scrollable/CustomElement' height={200}/>

You can use `<Scrollable/>` to add custom scrollbars to any type of element, like a `<textarea/>` for example.
By default, `<Scrollable/>` uses a `div` for the container element, but you can change that via the `element` prop.

In the example above we use a `<textarea/>` as the container element.
You can edit the content of the textarea, and the scrollbars will update automatically.

Similarly, you can pass a `div` with a `contenteditable` attribute:

```jsx
<Scrollable element={<textarea/>}>...</Scrollable>
<Scrollable element={<div contentEditable/>}>...</Scrollable>
```

## Examples

<PreviewList query='scrollable'/>

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Scrollable} from 'webrix/components';
import Scrollable from 'webrix/components/Scrollable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Scrollable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Props

Name               |Type    |Default     |Description
-------------------|--------|------------|---
`children`         |node    |`null`      |The scrollable content.
`element`          |node    |`<div/>`    |The scrollable element. Can be used for defining a different element (like `<textarea/>`), or for applying attributes to the default `<div/>`.
`style`            |object  |`{}`        |A style object to be used for styling the scrollbar. NOTE: This should only be used for values that are computed in runtime using JavaScript. Static values should be applied using CSS.
`scrollOnDOMChange`|boolean |`true`      |Specifies whether the scroll position should update when there's a change in the internal DOM structure. When set to `true`, adding an element above the visible area will update the scroll position so that the previously visible area is still visible.
`onScroll`         |function|`() => null`|A function to be called when a scroll event occurs. Receives an object with the following properties: `top`, `left`, `scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`, `scrollHeight`, `scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`,
`onUpdate`         |function|`() => null`|A function to be called when the scrollbars update. As opposed to `onScroll`, this is called every time the scrollbars change, including when the container resizes or when the content changed. Receives an object with the following properties: `top`, `left`, `scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`, `scrollHeight`, `scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`,
`cssVarsOnTracks`  |boolean |`false`     |Should be used if the scrollable DOM content consists of a large amount of DOM nodes, for perfromance reasons. [See *Chromium* bug report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1266517).

### CSS Custom Properties

The below CSS custom properties are applied at the component's top-level (See possible exceptions per-property)

CSS variables names are also available in the Object `Scrollable.constants.CSS_VARS`.

#### `--scrollable-vertical-ratio: <number>`

The ratio between the client height and the scroll height. You can consume this variable in a custom scrollbar.
> Note: This is a consumable property. Its value is automatically updated by `Scrollable`.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar-thumb {
  height: calc(var(--scrollable-vertical-ratio, 1) * 100%);
}
```

#### `--scrollable-horizontal-ratio: <number>`

The ratio between the client width and the scroll width. You can consume this variable in a custom scrollbar.
> Note: This is a consumable property. Its value is automatically updated by `Scrollable`.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar-thumb {
  width: calc(var(--scrollable-horizontal-ratio, 1) * 100%);
}
```

#### `--scrollable-scroll-top: <number>`

The *scroll top* position, represented as a number between `0` and `1`. You can consume this variable in a custom scrollbar.
> Note: This is a consumable property. Its value is automatically updated by `Scrollable`.

⚠️ If `cssVarsOnTracks` prop is set to `true`, this property will not be applied at the component's top-level but on the *vertical* track itself,
due to perfromance reasons described in the above *props* table.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar-thumb {
  top: calc(var(--scrollable-scroll-top, 0) * 100%);
}
```

#### `--scrollable-scroll-left: <number>`

The *scroll left* position, represented as a number between `0` and `1`. You can consume this variable in a custom scrollbar.
> Note: This is a consumable property. Its value is automatically updated by `Scrollable`.

⚠️ If `cssVarsOnTracks` prop is set to `true`, this property will not be applied at the component's top-level but on the *horizontal* track itself,
due to perfromance reasons described in the above *props* table.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar-thumb {
  left: calc(var(--scrollable-scroll-left, 0) * 100%);
}
```

#### `--scrollable-min-thumb-length: <number>`

The minimum scrollbar thumb size, defaults to `30px`.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar-thumb {
  --scrollable-min-thumb-length: 40px;
}
```

#### `--shadow-color: <color>`

Set the shadow's color. Applicable when using `<Scrollable.Shadow/>`

**Example:**

```css
.scroll-shadow {
  --shadow-color: blue;
}
```

#### `--scrollable-track-thickness: <length>`

Set the tracks's thickness.

Defaults to `12px`.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar {
  --scrollable-track-thickness: 12px;
}
```

#### `--scrollable-thumb-thickness: <length>`

Set the tracks's thumb thickness.

Defaults to half of `--scrollable-track-thickness`

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar {
  --scrollable-thumb-thickness: 6px;
}
```

#### `--scrollable-thumb-offset: <length>`

Set the tracks's thumb offset from all sides.

Defaults to `3px`

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar {
  --scrollable-thumb-thickness: 3px;
}
```

#### `--scrollable-thumb-color: <color>`

Set the thumb's color.

Defaults to `silver`

**Example:**

```css
.scrollbar {
  --scrollable-thumb-color: silver;
}
```
