import {Example} from 'components';

The `<Pannable/>` Component can be used to make content pannable (i.e. capable of being panned)
and scrollable in case container's size is smaller than size of content.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/pannable/BasicExample' height={400}/>

In this example `<Pannable/>` is wrapping an image that is larger than the container.
As a result, the content becomes scrollable, and also pannable (by clicking & dragging the content).

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Pannable} from 'webrix/components';
