The `<Movable/>` component can be used to create elements that the user can move.

As opposed to a draggable element, the `<Movable/>` component does not require a source/target configuration.
Instead, it supports 3 custom events (`onBeginMove`, `onMove`, `onEndMove`) through which you can control the movement.

The `<Movable/>` also comes with a custom hook for reduced boilerplate and easy constraint application.
That hook accepts an array of *Operations*, which are used for controlling the way an element is moved.
`<Movable/>` is packaged with a set of built-in *Operations* that you can use, and you can also create your own.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/movable/BasicExample' height={200}/>

In this example we are using the `Movable.useMove()` hook to control the movement.
The `useMove()` hook accepts an array of **operations**, which are processed in the order in which they are provided.

In this example we use 2 operations: `move()` and `update()`.
In the next section we will further discuss what operations are, and how they can be used.

## Operations

Operations are configuration objects that can be used to control the way an element moves, apply constraints,
or even execute functions based on events. The `Movable.useMove()` hook accepts an array of operations, and executes them in order.
An operation can also pass data forwards to the next operation, so that you can mix multiple operations together for achieving more
complex behaviors.

### Constraint Axis

<Example file='docs/components/movable/ConstraintAxis' height={200}/>

The `<Movable/>` component gives you complete control over the positioning of the element by only passing information
through the events without actually manipulating the element itself.
This way you are free to add your own logic and constraints.

In this example, we ignore the movement of the mouse on the `x` axis to constraint the element to the `y`
axis. We do that by only updating the `top` value of the position in the `update()` operation.

### Snapping

<Example file='docs/components/movable/Snapping' height={200}/>

Similarly to the previous example, more complex constraints can be applied using the provided
operations in `Movable.Operations`.

In the example above we're using the `Movable.Operations.snap()`
operation to make the movable element snap to a `20px` by `20px` grid.

<Example file='docs/components/movable/SnappingAdvanced' height={300}/>

In this example you can see how to apply different gird sizes and different snap strengths.

### Contain

<Example file='docs/components/movable/Contain' height={300}/>

In this example we're using the `Movable.Operations.contain()` operation to limit the movement
of the element within the boundaries of the given container.

### Mixing Operations

<Example file='docs/components/movable/Mixing' height={300}/>

In this example we're combining 2 different operations to achieve a more complex behavior.
You can mix as many operations as you need, but for optimal UX you will need to make sure
that the operations make sense when applied together.

For example, using `move()` and `trackpad()` together can produce strange results, since it makes no
sense to use a Movable component as a trackpad, and move it at the same time.

### Custom Operations

<Example file='docs/components/movable/CustomOperations' height={300}/>

You can create your own custom operations using the `Movable.Operations.createOperation()` function.
This function takes an object with one or more of the Movable's events (i.e. `onBeginMove`, `onMove` and `onEndMove`).

In this example, we create a custom operation called `snapClass`, that adds the given CSS class to the element when it
is snapped to the given grid.

Each Movable event receives 2 arguments:

* The original event object.
* An object with the data shared between events/operations.

You can pass data between events by mutating the 2nd argument, which is an object that is shared between all
the events, and across operations. This argument also contains a `next` key, where you should store
the next coordinates (in the above example we extract `next` from it to determine whether it will
be on the grid after all operations are applied).

## Trackpad

<Example file='docs/components/movable/MovableArea' height={300}/>

Until now we've been using the `move()` operation to move the element by clicking on it
and dragging it. However, in certain cases you don't want to click on the element, but rather on
the point you wish the element to move to (for example, in sliders).

For that you can use the `Movable.Operations.trackpad()` operation, as seen in the example above.
Click anywhere inside the dashed box to make the red circle move to that point.
Click & drag anywhere inside the dashed box to make the red circle follow the cursor.

## Custom Handlers

<Example file='docs/components/movable/Manual' height={200}/>

If you need some custom behavior that you cannot get using the `Movable` hooks, you can write your
own event handlers. When a user moves a `<Movable/>` element, the custom events (`onBeginMove`, `onMove`, `onEndMove`)
are triggered, passing the mouse position (`x/y`), the difference in the coordinates since the beginning of the event
(`dx/dy`), and the difference in the coordinates since the last event (`cx/cy`) as arguments.

In this example we are using the change in coordinates (`cx/cy`) for updating the `position` state.

Notice that we are using a function to set the state, instead of passing an object directly.
This is because the [state may be updated asynchronously](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous),
so we cannot rely on the state value for calculating the next position.

Using a function will give us the previous state as an argument, and we can use that to accurately calculate the
next position.

<Example file='docs/components/movable/ManualAdvanced' height={200}/>

You can avoid the issue explained above, and get a more user-friendly movement
by using the deltas (`dx/dy`) or the mouse position (`x/y`).
However, using them requires maintaining the initial position of the element as soon as the movement begins.
This can be done through the `onBeginMove` event, as can be seen in the above example.

## Examples

<PreviewList query='movable'/>

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Movable} from 'webrix/components';
import Movable from 'webrix/components/Movable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Movable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`onBeginMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be called when the user begins to move the element
`onMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be continuously called as the user moves the element around. Receives `x/y/dx/dy/cx/cy` as arguments (see description above for more info)
`onEndMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be called when the user stops moving the element

### Hooks

#### `Movable.useMove(operations = [])`

Generate the set of props to be injected to a `<Movable/>` component, applying the given operations.

```jsx
const props = Movable.useMove(operations);
<Movable {...props}/>
```

### Operations

#### `Movable.Operations.move(ref)`

Use the Movable component given in `ref` as a movable object.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  move(ref),
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.trackpad(ref)`

Use the Movable component given in `ref` as a trackpad, rather than a movable object.
This can be used for creating components like sliders, where you have a "track and the movement
is recorded on that track, but applied to a different element (like a handle).

See [Trackpad](#trackpad) above for additional info.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  trackpad(ref),
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.snap(horizontal, vertical, strength = 1)`

Snap the movement to a grid specified by the given `horizontal` & `vertical` sizes
of the grid steps, optionally specifying the snapping strength in `strength`, as a number between `0` and `1`.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  snap(20, 20), // Snap to a 20x20 grid
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.contain(movable, container)`

Limit the movement to the bounding rect of the given container.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  contain(movable, container),
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.transform(...transformers)`

Transform the current coordinates by applying the given `transformers`.
A transformer is simply a function that takes the current value, and returns a new value based on that.
You can use one of the built-in transformer in `Movable.Transformers`, or provide your own.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  transform(v => v.top), // Extract the 'top' key from the coordinates (for constraining movement to the y axis)
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.relative(ref)`

Convert the coordinates to be relative to the position of the given ref.

> Note - this operation should be called after operations that should not work relatively, like `contain()`,
> but before operations that should work relatively, like `snap()`.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  relative(ref), // Make coordinates relative to ref
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.update(callback)`

Call the function given in `callback`, passing the current coordinates as an argument.

```jsx
Movable.useMove([
  update(console.log), // Will log the next coordinates
]);
```

#### `Movable.Operations.createOperation(...)`

Create a custom operation to be passed to the `useMove()` hook. See [Custom Operations](#operations-custom-operations) above
for additional info.

```jsx
const myOperation = () => Movable.Operations.createOperation(...);
Movable.useMove([
  myOperation(...),
]);
```

### Transformers

#### `Movable.Transformers.map(imin, imax, omin, omax)`

#### `Movable.Transformers.decimals(count)`

#### `Movable.Transformers.interval(value)`

#### `Movable.Transformers.clamp(min, max)`

#### `Movable.Transformers.angle(imin, imax, omin, omax)`
