The `<Collapsible/>` component allows you to collapse/expand an element with arbitrary content height
and apply a nice transition to it. This is a challenge to achieve with CSS only, since it's impossible
to transition the `height` property from `0` to `auto` and vice versa.

We overcome this challenge by applying a height value based on the `clientHeight` of the content
and then setting it to `auto` as soon as the transition is completed so that further changes
in height are automatically applied. This essentially creates a transition between `0` and `auto`.

This means that a `<Collapsible/>` is able to expand/collapse from a height of `0` to the height
of its content, regardless of what the content is, and without any complex calculations.
You can even nest collapsibles!

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/collapsible/BasicExample' height={300}/>

In this example you can see a simple `<Collapsible/>` with a title and some content.
Clicking on the title toggles the collapsible from expanded to collapsed and vice versa.

## Nesting

<Example file='docs/components/collapsible/Nesting' height={450}/>

In this example you can see a `<Collapsible/>` with nested `<Collapsible/>` items.
The parent's height is automatically updated when its content height is changing, because
the `height` is actually set to `auto`.

## Examples

<PreviewList query='collapsible'/>
