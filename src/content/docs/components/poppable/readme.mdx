The `<Poppable/>` can be used for creating components that are "popping out" of the screen,
like **tooltips, dropdowns, context menus, popovers, modals** and so on.
These components can be positioned on the screen based on some reference element.

The `<Poppable/>` is using `<Stackable/>` internally to maintain a dynamic stacking context.
In addition, the `<Poppable/>` takes a placement configuration (a list of valid placements relative
to the reference element), and places itself based on that, while maintaining the poppable element
in the viewport.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/BasicExample' height={300}/>

In this example we have a movable `reference` (You can drag it around).
The `<Poppable/>` will attempt to keep the `target` within the `window` and close to the `reference`
based on the given supported placements.

Note that the default positioning is defined in this example to be at the **bottom**
of the `reference` element, so when the `<Poppable/>` repositions the target, it
will attempt to pick a position as close as possible to the default position.

In other words, the default position acts as a "magnet" for the `target`, and the `target`
is pulled towards the default position as much as possible while being contained in the `window`.

Note that moving the `reference` outside of the `window` will cause the target to disappear.

## Container

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/Container' height={400}/>

In this example we have a movable `container` and a movable `reference`.
Specifying a container can be useful if the `reference` is a descendant of an element that
prevents overflow (for example, using `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: scroll`),
and you want the target to hide when the `reference` is outside it.
In such a case, the `container` should be a reference to the element that prevents overflow.

## Placements

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/Placements' height={400}/>

Although you can provide whatever placements you like, we realize that certain placements are more common
than others. To that end we provide a set of placement utilities that can be used for easily generating
the more common placements for your `<Poppable/>`.

These placement utilities can be accessed through `Poppable.Placements`, and include dedicated functions
per orientation. For example, to position your target vertically above the reference (and horizontally
centered to it), you can use the following:

```js
const topcenter = (rbr, tbr) => {
    const {vbefore, hcenter} = Poppable.Placements;
    return {
        ...vbefore(rbr, tbr), // Vertically before (i.e. above)
        ...hcenter(rbr, tbr) // Horizontally centered
    };
};
```

## Triangle

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/Triangle' height={300}/>

It's common for popovers to have a triangle pointing to the reference to which it is attached.
For that end we created a component called `<Poppable.Triangle/>` that automatically positions
itself based on the placement of the popup.

It's doing so by computing the vertical/horizontal intersection between the two DOMRects and positioning
itself in the center of that intersection. So you regardless of what placements you provide to `Poppable`,
the `<Poppable.Triangle/>` will position itself automatically.

To set the color of the triangle, you can use the CSS custom property `--triangle-color`:
```css
.poppable-triangle {
  --triangle-color: blue;
}
```

## Context

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/Context' height={300}/>

Sometimes you need to position additional elements based on the position of the `reference`, the `target` or the `container`.
For this you need access to their bounding rects after the positioning process has been completed.
You can do so by using the `Poppable.Context` context provider.

In the above example you see you can create your own triangle and position it between the
reference and the target using `Poppable.Context`.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
    {tbr, rbr, cbr} = useContext(Poppable.Context);
    // Do somethig based on the bounding rects.
    return (...);
}
```

## Mouse Position

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/MousePosition' height={300}/>

In the previous examples we've seen how a `<Poppable/>` can be positioned based on a reference element.
In this example, the `<Poppable/>` is positioned based on the mouse position instead.

This can be done by passing a `DOMRect` as the `reference` prop, instead of a React ref.
The `DOMRect` x/y (or left/top) coordinates should be set to the mouse' `clientX` and `clientY` properties, respectively.

In the above example, clicking inside the *Clickable Area* will show the `Target`, placing it
at the coordinates where the mouse clicked. Clicking outside the *Clickable Area* will hide the `Target`.

## Manual Control

<Example file='docs/components/poppable/ManualControl' height={300}/>

`Poppable.Manual` is a lower-level version of `Poppable` where the state is "lifted up" to the containing
layer. `Poppable.Manual` does not maintain a state of its own for the placement, and instead expects the containing layer
to provide that as props. This gives you the capability to fully control the positioning of the
target if needed.

In the previous examples the reference was movable, and the target was attached to it.
In this example, we use `Poppable.Manual` to allow the user to move the target as well.
Moving the target will hide the triangle, since it is now "detached" from the reference.
Clicking on the tack icon will re-attach the target with the reference.

## Positioning Algorithm

Below are the steps in the positioning algorithm, in case you are interested in understanding the inner workings
of `<Poppable/>`:

 1. Filter the array of valid placements, removing those that will cause the target to overflow the container.
 1. Sort the resulting array based on the distance from the default placement, from shortest distance to longest distance.
 1. Choose the first element in the resulting array if exists.
 1. Otherwise choose the default placement (this will only occur if no placement was determined to be valid).

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
    const [placement, setPlacement] = useState(); // Don't provide an initial state to allow the popover to use its own default state.

    return (
        <Poppable.Manual placements={...} placement={placement} onPlacement={setPlacement}>
            <SomeTarget/>
        </Poppable>
    );
}
```

## Examples

<PreviewList query='poppable'/>
