The `<Resizable/>` component can be used to create elements that the user can resize.

A `<Resizable/>` element can receive up to 8 resizers, which can be used to resize the element in
all directions - horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

The `<Resizable/>` comes with a custom hook for reduced boilerplate and easy constraint application.
That hook accepts an array of *Operations*, which are used for controlling the way an element is resized.
`<Resizable/>` is packaged with a set of built-in *Operations* that you can use, and you can also create your own.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/BasicExample' height={300}/>

In this example we are using the `Resizable.useResize()` hook to control the resizing of the element.
The `onResize` callback is called when the element moves, passing an object with `top/left/width/height`
as an argument.

## Operations

As mentioned before, operations can be used to create custom resizing behaviours.
The `<Resizable/>` component comes we a set of pre-defined operations that you can
access through `Resizable.Operations`.

### Min/Max Sizes

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/MinMax' height={350}/>

In the example above we're using the `min(width, height)` and `max(width, height)` operation to limit the resizing
to a certain minimum & maximum dimensions.

### Snapping

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/Snapping' height={300}/>

In the example above we're using the `Resizable.Operations.snap(horizontal, vertical, strength)` operation to
make the resizable element snap to a `20px` by `20px` grid.

In the example below we use the same operation, only here the grid size is `60px` by `60px`, and the snapping
strength is set to `0.3`. The snapping strength is a number between `0` and `1`, where `1` corresponds to
full strength and `0` to no strength (and therefore, no snapping).

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/SnappingAdvanced' height={300}/>

### Contain

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/Contain' height={300}/>

In this example we're using the `Resizable.Operations.contain(container)` operation, to limit the
resizing of the element to not overflow the boundaries of the given container.

### Ratio

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/Ratio' height={300}/>

In this example we're using the `Resizable.Operations.ratio(value)` operations, to
maintain a given ratio when resizing.

The `ratio` operation accepts a number representing the ratio that you wish to maintain
between the width and the height of the element. For example, a ratio of `2` will maintain
an element width that is double the element's height.

### Mixing Operations

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/Mixing' height={300}/>

In this example we're combining 4 different operations to achieve a more complex behavior.
You can mix as many operations as you need, but for optimal UX you will need to make sure
that the operations make sense when applied together.

For example, applying a `ratio` of `4/3` while having a `snap` of `40, 40` will void the `ratio`
in certain cases since they are contradictory. Instead, the `snap` should use values that maintain
the given ratio, like `40, 30`.

### Custom Operations

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/CustomOperations' height={300}/>

You can create your own custom operations using the `Resizable.Operations.createOperation()` function.
This function takes an object with the Resizable's events (i.e. `onBeginResize`, `onResize` and `onEndResize`).

In this example, we create a custom operation called `snapClass`, that adds the given CSS class to the element when it
is snapped to the given grid.

Each Resizable event receives 2 arguments:

* The original event object.
* An object with the data shared between events/operations.

You can pass data between events by mutating the 2rd argument, which is an object that is shared between all
the events, and across operations. This argument also contains a `next` key, where you should store
the next Resizable coordinates (in the above example we extract `next` from it to determine whether it will
be on the grid after all operations are applied).

## Custom Directions

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/CustomDirections' height={300}/>

Instead of using `<Resizable.Resizers.All/>`, you can use any combination of resizers to limit
the resize operation to certain directions. In this example we use `Right`,`Bottom` and `BottomRight`
resizers to allow the element to be resized only at those edges/coreners.

## Custom Handlers

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/CustomHandlers' height={300}/>

Up to this point we've been using the `Resizable.useResize()` hook.
The hook returns an object with `onBeginResize`, `onResize` and `onEndResize` handlers,
which should be injected to the `<Resizable/>`.

However, you can create your own handlers, if you need a special behavior that is not covered
by that hook (and its accompanying set of operations).

The `onResize` prop can be used to listen to resize changes.
It passes an object with `width`, `height`, `top` and `left` keys to the handler.
These values represent the change (delta) in dimensions/position, rather than
the actual new dimensions/position.

To get the actual dimensions/position, simply add the deltas to the initial values.

## Examples

<PreviewList query='resizable'/>

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Resizable} from 'webrix/components';
import Resizable from 'webrix/components/Resizable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Resizable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Props

### Hooks

#### `Resizable.useResize(operations)`

Generate the set of props to be injected to a `<Resizable/>` component, applying the given operations.

```jsx
const props = Resizable.useResize(operations);
<Resizable {...props}/>
```

### Operations

#### `Resizable.Operations.min(width, height)`

Limit the resizing to not go below the given width/height.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  Resizable.Operations.min(100, 100), // Enforce a minimum width/height of 100/100
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.max(width, height)`

Limit the resizing to not go above the given width/height.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  Resizable.Operations.max(100, 100), // Enforce a minimum width/height of 100/100
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.snap(horizontal, vertical, strength = 1)`

Snap the resizing to a grid specified by the given `horizontal` & `vertical` arguments,
optionally specifying the snapping strength in `strength`, as a number between `0` and `1`.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  Resizable.Operations.snap(20, 20), // Snap to 20x20 grid
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.contain(container)`

Limit the resizing to not overflow the bounding rect of the given container.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  Resizable.Operations.contain(ref),
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.ratio(value)`

Maintain the given ratio when resizing. The given value represents the ratio between the width
and the height. For example, to maintain a `4:3` ratio, use the value `4/3`.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  Resizable.Operations.ratio(4/3),
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.relative(ref)`

Convert the coordinates to be relative to the position of the given ref.

> Note - this operation should be called after operations that should not work relatively, like `contain()`,
> but before operations that should work relatively, like `snap()`.

```jsx
Resizable.useMove([
  relative(ref), // Make coordinates relative to ref
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.update(callback)`

Call the function given in `callback`, passing the current coordinates as an argument.

```jsx
Resizable.useResize([
  update(console.log), // Will log the next coordinates
]);
```

#### `Resizable.Operations.createOperation(...)`

Create a custom operation to be passed to the `useResize()` hook. See [Custom Operations](#operations-custom-operations) above
for additional info.

```jsx
const myOperation = () => Resizable.Operations.createOperation(...);
Resizable.useResize([
  myOperation(...),
]);
```
