import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

## Features

* `Scrollable` - Changed class name from `scrollbar` to `scrollable`
* `Scrollable` - Added CSS custom property `--scrollable-thumb-color` . See <Link to='/docs/components/scrollable#api-css-custom-properties'>Scrollable CSS API</Link>.
* `Scrollable` - Added `Scrollable.Context` through which the `container` ref is available.
* `Scrollable` - Removed branding styles to have it as "white-label" as possible. See <a href='https://github.com/open-amdocs/webrix/pull/83'>PR #83</a>
* `Scrollable` - The component now utilizes any prop applied to it. (`<div {...this.props} ...`).
* `Movable` - `useMemo` is no longer needed inside a `useMove`:
              `Movable.useMove(useMemo(() => [...], [...]))` → `Movable.useMove([...])`
* `Resizable` - Same change as above: `Resizable.useResize(useMemo(() => [...], []))` → `Resizable.useResize([...])`
